Your browser already fills in your username and password, so why not have it click submit also?

To use, browse to a site for which your username and password get filled by Chrome.  The Auto Login icon will appear next to the site's URL.  Click the icon and set that page for automatic login.

The next time you visit that page, a loading message will (optionally) flash on the screen as the page is automatically submitted.

If you'd like to remove a page from the Auto Login list, you can do so on the options page.

To install, see the extension page here: <a href='https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/oeoibdmcpaofjgcdncagknlmlmngkgfm'><a href='https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/oeoibdmcpaofjgcdncagknlmlmngkgfm'>https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/oeoibdmcpaofjgcdncagknlmlmngkgfm</a></a>
